MATLAB code for Project 2 of ECE 2312 Discrete-Time Signal and System Analysis at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA.

ECE_2312_Project1 is the singular file that generates all of the mono audio signals and stereo audio signal, along with their respective spectrograms. To create a less irritating script, all "sound()" functions are commented out to prevent from constantly hearing the awful 5kHz sine tone noise.

To correctly utilize the code, download the "FirstPhrase.wav" file in the github and run the script.
